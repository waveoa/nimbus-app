## Installation

To get Nimbus up and running on your Discord server, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Before installing Nimbus, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Git**: For cloning the repository.
- **Node.js**: Nimbus is built on Node.js, so you'll need it to run the bot.
- **npm**: Node.js package manager, which is typically installed with Node.js.
- **A Discord Bot Token**: You can obtain this by creating a bot in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

### Cloning the Repository

To clone the Nimbus repository, open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/waveoa/nimbus-app.git
```

Navigate into the cloned directory:

```bash
cd Nimbus
```

### Setting Up the Bot

1. **Install Dependencies**: Run the following command to install all the required Node.js packages:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configuration**: Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add your bot token and other necessary configurations:

   ```plaintext
   DISCORD_TOKEN=your-discord-bot-token
   PREFIX=!
   ```

   Replace `your-discord-bot-token` with the token you obtained from the Discord Developer Portal. The `PREFIX` is the symbol you'll use before commands (e.g., `!ban`).

3. **Start the Bot**: To start Nimbus, simply run:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   Nimbus should now be online and responding to commands in your Discord server!

## Usage

Once the bot is running, you can start using its various features by typing commands in your Discord server. Here are a few examples:

- `/help`: Displays a list of available commands and their usage.
- `/ban @user [reason]`: Bans a user from the server.
- `/mute @user [duration]`: Mutes a user for a specified amount of time.
- `/warn @user [reason]`: Issues a warning to a user.

For a full list of commands and their details, type `!help` in your server after setting up Nimbus.
