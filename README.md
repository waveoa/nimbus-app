## Installation

To get Nimbus up and running on your Discord server, follow these detailed steps:

### Prerequisites

Before installing Nimbus, make sure you have the following installed and set up:

1. **Git:** You'll need Git to clone the Nimbus repository. Download and install Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).

2. **Node.js:** Nimbus runs on Node.js. Download and install the latest version from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/). This installation also includes npm, the Node.js package manager.

3. **A Discord Bot Token:** You'll need a bot token to run Nimbus. Create a bot on the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and copy the token.

### Setting Up Nimbus

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   Open your terminal or command prompt and clone the Nimbus repository using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/waveoa/nimbus-app.git
   ```

   This will create a local copy of the repository on your machine. Change into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd nimbus-app
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   Nimbus relies on several Node.js packages to function correctly. Install these dependencies by running:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   This command will download and install all the necessary packages listed in the `package.json` file.

3. **Create a Configuration File:**

   Nimbus requires a `.env` file for configuration. This file contains sensitive information and settings. Create the file in the root directory of the project. You can do this using a text editor or by running:

   ```bash
   touch .env
   ```

   Open the `.env` file in a text editor and add the following lines:

   ```plaintext
   DISCORD_TOKEN=your-discord-bot-token
   PREFIX=!
   ```

   Replace `your-discord-bot-token` with the token you obtained from the Discord Developer Portal. The `PREFIX` is the character that will precede commands (e.g., `!ban`).

4. **Verify Your Configuration:**

   Double-check your `.env` file to ensure it is correctly configured. Incorrect settings here can prevent Nimbus from starting.

5. **Run Database Migrations (if applicable):**

   If Nimbus uses a database, you may need to run migrations or initialize the database schema. This step is usually documented in the project’s README or setup guide. Run the following command if migrations are required:

   ```bash
   npm run migrate
   ```

   This command ensures that the database is set up correctly before running the bot.

6. **Start Nimbus:**

   With everything configured, start the Nimbus bot by running:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   Nimbus should now be running and ready to respond to commands in your Discord server. If you encounter any errors, check the console output for troubleshooting information.

## Usage

Once Nimbus is running, you can interact with it using various commands. Here are a few examples:

- `/help`: Displays a list of available commands and their descriptions.
- `/ban @user [reason]`: Bans a user from the server.
- `/mute @user [duration]`: Mutes a user for a specified duration.
- `/warn @user [reason]`: Issues a warning to a user.

For a full list of commands, type `!help` in your server after Nimbus is set up.
