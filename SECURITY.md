## Numbis Security Policy

### Overview

The Numbis Discord app aims to provide a secure and reliable platform for users. This Security Policy outlines the practices and measures in place to safeguard our GitHub repository, codebase, and associated data.

### 1. Access Control

**1.1. Repository Access**

- **Access Levels**: Only authorized personnel will have access to the Numbis GitHub repository. Access levels will be assigned based on roles (e.g., Admin, Contributor, Read-Only).

### 2. Data Protection

**2.1. Code and Data Security**

- **Sensitive Information**: Sensitive information, such as API keys, passwords, and configuration details, must not be stored in the repository. Use environment variables or secret management tools.

**3.2. Documentation**

- **Security Documentation**: Keep security-related documentation up-to-date and accessible to contributors. This includes guidelines for secure coding practices and handling sensitive data.
- **Change Logs**: Document all significant changes to the codebase, especially those related to security, in the repository’s change logs.
