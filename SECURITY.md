# Nimbus - Security Policy

## Overview

The Nimbus Discord app is dedicated to providing a secure and reliable platform. This Security Policy outlines the measures and practices we have implemented to protect our GitHub repository, codebase, and associated data.

## 1. Access Control

**1.1. Repository Access**

- **Access Levels:** Access to the Nimbus GitHub repository is limited to authorized personnel only. Permissions are assigned based on roles such as Admin, Contributor, or Read-Only.
- **Authentication:** Users must utilize strong, unique passwords and enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for their GitHub accounts.
- **SSH Keys:** Access via SSH keys is permitted, and these keys should be rotated regularly to ensure security.

**1.2. User Management**

- **Onboarding:** New contributors will be granted access only after completing the necessary onboarding procedures, including reviewing this Security Policy.
- **Offboarding:** Access will be promptly revoked upon termination of involvement with the project or if any security concerns arise.

## 2. Data Protection

**2.1. Code and Data Security**

- **Sensitive Information:** Sensitive information such as API keys, passwords, and configuration details must not be stored in the repository. Use environment variables or secret management tools instead.
- **Code Reviews:** All code changes must undergo peer reviews to identify and address potential security vulnerabilities before merging.

**2.2. Incident Response**

- **Reporting:** Report any security incidents or vulnerabilities immediately to the Nimbus security team through designated channels (e.g., email or issue tracker).
- **Response:** The security team will assess and address reported incidents promptly, following an established incident response plan.

## 3. Best Practices for Contributors

**3.1. Development Practices**

- **Branch Management:** Develop features in separate branches and submit changes through pull requests, which must be reviewed by peers before merging.
- **Testing:** Implement and run automated tests to ensure code quality and security before merging changes into the main branch.

**3.2. Documentation**

- **Security Documentation:** Keep security-related documentation up-to-date and accessible to all contributors. This includes guidelines for secure coding practices and handling sensitive data.
- **Change Logs:** Record all significant changes, especially those related to security, in the repository’s change logs.

## 4. Compliance

**4.1. Legal and Regulatory Compliance**

- **Data Protection Laws:** Ensure compliance with relevant data protection laws and regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) in the development and management of the Nimbus app.

**4.2. License Agreements**

- **Licensing:** Adhere to the terms of open-source licenses for any third-party libraries and tools used in the Nimbus project.

## 5. Policy Review

**5.1. Regular Updates**

- **Review Cycle:** This Security Policy will be reviewed and updated annually or as needed to address emerging security threats and changes in the project’s scope.

**5.2. Feedback**

- **Contributors’ Input:** Contributors are encouraged to provide feedback on this Security Policy and suggest improvements.
