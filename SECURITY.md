# Numbis Security Policy

## Overview

The Numbis Discord app is committed to delivering a secure and reliable platform. This Security Policy details the measures and practices we have implemented to protect our GitHub repository, codebase, and associated data.

## 1. Access Control

**1.1. Repository Access**

- **Access Levels:** Access to the Numbis GitHub repository is restricted to authorized personnel only. Permissions are assigned based on roles such as Admin, Contributor, or Read-Only.
- **Authentication:** All users must use strong, unique passwords and enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for their GitHub accounts.
- **SSH Keys:** Access via SSH keys is allowed, and these keys should be rotated regularly to maintain security.

**1.2. User Management**

- **Onboarding:** New contributors will receive access only after completing onboarding procedures, including reviewing this Security Policy.
- **Offboarding:** Access will be revoked immediately upon the termination of involvement with the project or if any security issues arise.

## 2. Data Protection

**2.1. Code and Data Security**

- **Sensitive Information:** Sensitive data such as API keys, passwords, and configuration details must not be stored in the repository. Instead, use environment variables or secret management tools.
- **Code Reviews:** All code changes must undergo peer reviews to identify and address potential security vulnerabilities before they are merged.

**2.2. Incident Response**

- **Reporting:** Report any security incidents or vulnerabilities immediately to the Numbis security team through designated channels (e.g., email or issue tracker).
- **Response:** The security team will assess and address reported incidents promptly, following a structured incident response plan.

## 3. Best Practices for Contributors

**3.1. Development Practices**

- **Branch Management:** Use feature branches for development and submit changes through pull requests, which must be reviewed by peers before merging.
- **Testing:** Implement and run automated tests to ensure code quality and security prior to merging changes into the main branch.

**3.2. Documentation**

- **Security Documentation:** Maintain up-to-date security-related documentation accessible to all contributors. This includes guidelines for secure coding practices and the handling of sensitive data.
- **Change Logs:** Document all significant changes, particularly those related to security, in the repository’s change logs.

## 4. Compliance

**4.1. Legal and Regulatory Compliance**

- **Data Protection Laws:** Ensure compliance with applicable data protection laws and regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) in the development and management of the Numbis app.

**4.2. License Agreements**

- **Licensing:** Adhere to the terms of open-source licenses for any third-party libraries and tools used in the Numbis project.

## 5. Policy Review

**5.1. Regular Updates**

- **Review Cycle:** This Security Policy will be reviewed and updated annually or as necessary to address emerging security threats and changes in the project’s scope.

**5.2. Feedback**

- **Contributors’ Input:** Contributors are encouraged to provide feedback on this Security Policy and suggest improvements.
